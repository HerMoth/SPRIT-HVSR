# Python HVSR Toolset

- HoVerSpectRa
- SpRIT (HV): Spectral Ratio Investigation Toolset (Horizontal Vertical Ratio)


This python package is a re-packaged version of the Incorporated Research Institutions in Seismology (IRIS) Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR) processing package.[1]

That version is intended to read data from the IRIS Data Management Center (DMC) MUSTANG online service[2], which is a toolbox that provides processes for enabling data quality analysis services to data archived in the DMC. For example, a simple service query can extract power spectral density estimates, noise spectrograms, etc.
