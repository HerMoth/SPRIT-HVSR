Next steps to include:
- include dfa as an option for combining H components
- User selection of windows
- Smoothing of data
    - Interpolate or resample to get more points on HV curve
- Add option to read in datastream with three components directly

From J-SESAME:
- sta/lta "antitrigger" to automatically identify transients
- Signal saturation filter (exclude data where peak amplitude exceeds 99.5% of max)
- Noisy window filter (exclude data where peak amplitude exceeds 80% of the peak LTA)
