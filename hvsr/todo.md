Next steps to include:
- include dfa as an option for combining H components
- User selection of windows
- Additional data sources (esp, nodes)

From J-SESAME:
- sta/lta "antitrigger" to automatically identify transients
- Signal saturation filter (exclude data where peak amplitude exceeds 99.5% of max)
- Noisy window filter (exclude data where peak amplitude exceeds 80% of the peak LTA)
